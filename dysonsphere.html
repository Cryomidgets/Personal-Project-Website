      <!--Introduction-->
      <div class="s1">
        <p class="body_introduction">In 1960, the physicist Freeman Dyson published a paper stating that a energy hungry civilisation would turn to their parent star to harvest as much energy as possible by encompassing it with a megastructure. Dyson then proposed a search for point sources of infrared radiation since the radiation from these covered stars would be infrared at a length of 10 microns. He went on to say that in a few thousand years past industrial development, any intelligent species would construct this structure. This megastructure became known as the dyson sphere.</p>

      <!--Function-->
      <div class="s2">
        <h2 class="dyson_subheading" id="h2"><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
      </div>

      <div class="s3">
        <p class="body_body">A dyson sphere could provide levels of energy beyond anything humans could imagine, with sufficient energy to power projects of planetary scale. This increase in our energy store would give our species a jump from type 0 to type 2 on the Kardashev scale. With mirrors or solar panels on the interior, the dyson sphere would acquire energy to power all possible energy needs in the world. However the sphere structure would be difficult to build and even more so to maintain with impacts from asteroids proving fatal and the structure liable to collapse into the sun.</p>

        <p class="body_body">Due to the impossible magnitude of a project covering the entire sun, Dr. Stuart Armstrong, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute has proposed a plan to build a dyson swarm; a swarm of many mirrors or solar panels encompassing the sun in a similar fashion to a dyson sphere, but much more practical. Due to the large number of devices in the swarm, space debris and asteroids would be no problem although even with these advantages there is the problem of resources which earth definitely cannot provide.</p>

      <ol>
        <div class="s7">
          <li>
              <p class="dyson_steps">Send automated, self-replicating robots to mercury and build solar panels or mirrors to power mining operations. Humans would be too expensive to maintain in such conditions. So close to the sun, solar panels would attain many times more energy than on earth.</p>

          <li>
            <p class="dyson_steps">Using the equipment brought from earth and the energy from the solar panels, the machines would mine raw resources from mercury’s crust as factories constructed would refine the materials and mass produce the mirrors and/or solar panels that make up the dyson swarm.</p>
          </li>
        </div>

        <div class="s9">
          <li>
              <p class="dyson_steps">Once the first solar panels or mirrors were launched their energy would be used along with the resources mined to construct more factories, mining machines, and robots to increase the rate of production. </p>

      <!--Conclusion-->
      <div class="s10">
        <p class="body_conclusion">Though a dyson sphere may seem a far off idea, by the time humans master travel across the solar system and the shift to renewable energy is complete, the level of climate change, pollution, or a shortage in earth’s resources may force us to colonise mars or begin asteroid mining. In such a time, humans may be forced to build a dyson sphere for energy alone and what seemed impossible would become inevitable.</p>
