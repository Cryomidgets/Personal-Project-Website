      <!--Introduction-->
      <div class="s1">
        <p class="body_introduction">A warp drive, a machine that travels fasters than light, is one of the most far fetched science fiction inventions; or is it? In 1994 the Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre presented an equation that stretches the fabric of space-time to allow travel FTL (faster than light) travel. This equation showed that a disturbance in the fabric of space-time would create a ripple in space, named the Alcubierre metric, that contracted space in front of it and expanded space behind it. Instead of moving through space, we should make space move around us.</p>

      <!--Function-->
      <div class="s2">
        <h2 class="warp_subheading" id="h2"><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class="s3">
        <p class="body_body">A ripple in the fabric of space-time would move FTL, while an object inside this ripple would not really move since this region of space is not moving, but bending the space around it to travel which is in keeping with Einstein’s law of relativity. At first glance, this equation seems to give us a cheat code to travel across the galaxy, but there’s a catch. A massive amount of energy is needed to create this disturbance and even with this much energy, its not clear how this disturbance may be created. Another complication is that it is also unclear how to exit or stop the bubble once it begins moving. These problems arise from the fact that this theory is just that, a theory. The reason that this equation was originally discarded is that it stated that negative energy would be needed and the amount of it would be equivalent to more positive energy than there is in the universe.</p>

        <p class="body_body">The most prominent research regarding the warp drive was conducted by Dr. Harold White and his team at Eagleworks at NASA. Before retiring from NASA, White discovered that by thickening the ring around the bubble, the mass of energy needed could be reduced to the size of Jupiter and again reduced to around 2 metric tonnes. However, the challenge of creating negative energy at all is still the biggest hurdle.</p>

      <!--Conclusion-->
      <div class="s6">
        <p class="body_conclusion">Though the warp drive can theoretically exist in accordance with general relativity, we still lack the means of producing a warp bubble. On the bright side, the equation is constantly being adjusted to improve the amount of energy with many teams working on producing warp bubbles. One day we may master the warp drive and become a galactic species.</p>
