      <!--Introduction-->
      <div class="s1">
        <p class="body_introduction">A warp drive, a machine that travels fasters than light, is one of the most far fetched science fiction inventions; or is it? In 1994 the Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre presented an equation that stretches the fabric of space-time to allow travel FTL (faster than light) travel. This equation showed that a disturbance in the fabric of space-time would create a ripple in space, that would allow objects in the ripple to move FTL.</p>

      <div class="s3">
        <p class="body_body">In 1994 the physicist Miguel Alcubierre published a paper on a proposed method to create a warp drive by stretching the fabric of space-time. To create the warp drive, there would have to be a disturbance. After the disturbance was created, there would be a moving region of space called a warp bubble that would contract space in front of it and expand space behind it in order to move. A warp bubble would move FTL, while an object inside this bubble of space would not really move since the object wouldn’t be moving but the space in the warp bubble would which is in keeping with Einstein’s law of relativity.</p>

        <p class="body_body">At first glance, this equation seems to give us a cheat code to travel across the galaxy, but there’s a catch. A massive amount of energy is needed to create this disturbance and even with this much energy, it’s not clear how this disturbance may be created. Another complication is that it is also unclear how to exit or stop the bubble once it begins moving. These problems arise from the fact that this theory is just that, a theory. The reason that this equation was originally discarded is that it stated that negative energy would be needed and the amount of it would be equivalent to more positive energy than there is in the universe.</p>

        <img src="/Photos/IS01085-feature-4x3.jpg">
        <p class="body_body">The most popular research regarding the warp drive was conducted by Dr. Harold White and his team at Eagleworks at NASA. Before retiring from NASA, White discovered that by thickening the ring around the bubble, the mass of energy needed could be reduced to the size of Jupiter and again reduced to around 2 metric tonnes. However, the challenge of creating negative energy at all is still the biggest hurdle.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="s8">
        <p class="body_body">More recently, there were two papers released around April 2021 about methods in which positive energy can be used to create a warp bubble. However, there are many problems even with using positive energy to create warp bubbles. In one of the papers by Alexey Bobrick and Gianni Martire there was a method to use positive energy to make a warp bubble moving slower than light. In the other paper by Erik Lentz positive energy could be used to create a warp bubble FTL, but the amount of positive energy needed to create a warp bubble the size of an airplane would be equivalent to 20%-30% of the sun’s mass which is a vast amount of energy since the sun will only have converted 5% of its mass to energy in its lifetime. Even if humans somehow harnessed all the sun’s energy, we would need more from outside our solar system. It seems we need a warp drive to gain the energy to create a warp drive.</p>

      <!--Conclusion-->
      <div class="s9">
        <p class="body_conclusion">Though the warp drive can theoretically exist in accordance with general relativity, we still lack the means of producing a warp bubble. On the bright side, the equation is constantly being adjusted to improve the amount of energy needed with many teams scientists working on new papers. One day when the technology progressing and the energy costs decreasing meet, humans may master the warp drive and become a galactic species.</p>
