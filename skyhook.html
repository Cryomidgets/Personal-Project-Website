      <!--Introduction-->
      <div class="s1">
        <p class="body_introduction">The best space companies across the world use professions mechanical, chemical, electronic, and aerospace engineers along with thermodynamicists, aerodynamics and structural designers, systems engineers, and many more to build, maintain, pilot, and monitor rockets. But what if there was another way to reach space that was cheaper, used a fraction of the fuel, and provided passengers with enough velocity to reach other planets? Rather than a theoretical science fiction model, the skyhook is a realistic already achievable structure.</p>
      </div>

      <!--Function-->
      <div class="s2">
        <h2 class="skyhook_subheading" id="h2"><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
      </div>

      <div class="s3">
        <p class="body_body">A seemingly simple concept, a skyhook consists of a cable with a weight on one end and a counterweight on the other, called a tether. The cable can be hundreds or thousands of kilometres long and made of fibres from materials that already exist that can withstand the conditions of space as well as space debris or meteors.</p>

      <div class="s4">
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*51_bw6sLVVR8FjOsC-2hkg.png">
        <p class="body_body">The cable with the counterweight rotates around the main weight as the tether orbits the earth in the same way that the earth rotates as it orbits the sun. Even though the minimum height of tethers is above the mesosphere at 80km to avoid igniting, this height is still many times more feasible to achieve than the cost of launching rockets. At its lowest point, the tether’s counterweight travels at approximately 12,000 kmph with much higher speeds at its furthest point. The spacecraft travelling to the tether only needs to be at 1,000 kmph as opposed to the 40,000 kmph a rocket needs to escape the atmosphere.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="s5">
        <p class="body_body">This makes it easy to transport cargo and passengers in specialised aircraft to travel to other planets. A trip to mars would only take 3-9 months, and tethers built on mars or its moons would extend our reach even further. A network of tethers could easily traverse the entire solar system using technology that can be built today. The main complication is that spaceships launched could reduce the speed of the tether until it enters the atmosphere and crashes. This problem is easily solved by balancing the number of spaceships released with ones that return using the tether in reverse, catching them at high velocity and releasing them at lower velocities. General changes in velocity can be corrected my small engines attached to the main weight.</p>

      <!--Benefits-->

        <h2 class="skyhook_subheading" id="h2"><strong>Benefits</strong></h2>

      <ol>
        <div class="s7">
          <li>
              <p class="skyhook_benefits">1.	Space Tourism – With tethers although space travel will be expensive, it will become much cheaper than before. The size of the spacecraft used to reach the tether will scale down from 84% - 96% compared to the size of a rocket. This will produce a new industry; space tourism. With the much cheaper cost of travelling to space and no training needed, companies will be able to commercialise space travel. As costs reduce over time, the industry will grow leading to job creation which profits economy.</p>

          <li>
              <p class="skyhook_benefits">2.	Asteroid Mining – Due to the complication of leaving earth orbit removed, spaceships can be sent to the asteroid belt to mine resources. This solves the problem of resource depletion on earth while creating jobs in a circular economy due to the near limitless cache of resources in the asteroid belt. Ships with sufficient resources can reach other planets and mine resources, providing more streams of resources to grow and supply the economy.</p>

        <div class="s9">
          <li>
              <p class="skyhook_benefits">3.	Bases in Space – Once specialised spacecraft is mass produced fleets of cargo ships can travel to other planets or moons not only to mine them for resources, but to establish tethers and bases. These bases would make interplanetary transportation more interconnected and allow humans to expand their reach across the solar system. These steps would give humans fallbacks to issues on earth such as global warming and pollution and set up the measures needed to terraform planets in the goldilocks zone.</p>

      <!--Conclusion-->
      <div class="s10">
        <p class="body_conclusion">Using tethers is not only more cost effective, using less fuel, and more payload than rockets do, but it creates jobs with new industries, makes travel across the solar system possible, and unlocks a virtually limitless store of resources. With the technology to build tethers today and many economic and scientific benefits, there is no reason not to build tethers now.</p>
