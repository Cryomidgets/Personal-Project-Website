      <!--Introduction-->
      <div class="s1">
        <p class="body_introduction">The best space companies across the world use professions mechanical, chemical, electronic, and aerospace engineers along with thermodynamicists, aerodynamics and structural designers, systems engineers, and many more to build, maintain, pilot, and monitor rockets. But what if there was another way to reach space that was cheaper, used a fraction of the fuel, and provided passengers with enough velocity to reach other planets? Rather than a theoretical science fiction model, the skyhook is a realistic already achievable structure.</p>
      </div>

      <!--Function-->
      <div class="s2">
        <h2 class="skyhook_subheading" id="h2"><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
      </div>

      <div class="s3">
        <p class="body_body">A seemingly simple concept, a skyhook consists of a cable with a weight on one end and a counterweight on the other, called a tether. The cable can be hundreds or thousands of kilometres long and made of fibres from materials that already exist that can withstand the conditions of space as well as space debris or meteors.</p>

      <div class="s4">
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*51_bw6sLVVR8FjOsC-2hkg.png">
        <p class="body_body">The cable with the counterweight rotates around the main weight as the tether orbits the earth in the same way that the earth rotates as it orbits the sun. Even though the minimum height of tethers is above the mesosphere at 80km to avoid igniting, this height is still many times more feasible to achieve than the cost of launching rockets. At its lowest point, the tetherâ€™s counterweight travels at approximately 12,000 kmph with much higher speeds at its furthest point. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="s5">
        <p class="body_body">This makes it easy to transport cargo and passengers in specialised aircraft to travel to other planets. A trip to mars would only take 3-9 months, and tethers built on mars or its moons would extend our reach even further. A network of tethers could easily traverse the entire solar system using technology that can be built today. The main complication is that spaceships launched could reduce the speed of the tether until it enters the atmosphere and crashes. This problem is easily solved by balancing the number of spaceships released with ones that return using the tether in reverse, catching them at high velocity and releasing them at lower velocities. General changes in velocity can be corrected my small engines attached to the main weight.</p>

      <!--Conclusion-->
      <div class="s10">
        <p class="body_conclusion">Using tethers is not only more cost effective, using less fuel, and more payload than rockets do, but it creates jobs with new industries, makes travel across the solar system possible, and unlocks a virtually limitless store of resources. With the technology to build tethers today and many economic and scientific benefits, there is no reason not to build tethers now.</p>
